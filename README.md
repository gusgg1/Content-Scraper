# Content Scraper

#### Project 6

###### This is my sixth of twelve projects for the Techdegree Full Stack JavaScript.

A Node.js command-line application that goes to an e-commerce site to get the latest prices and save them to a spreadsheet in CSV format.

This application scrapes content from [www.shirts4mike.com](http://www.shirts4mike.com/).  

To run this application type on the command line:  
* `npm install`  

then  

* `npm start`  

Data will be saved under `./data`.
